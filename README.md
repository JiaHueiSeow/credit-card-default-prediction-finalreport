# credit-card-default-prediction-finalreport

## Project Overview
This project investigates credit card default prediction using the Default of Credit Card Clients dataset.
The objective is to identify key factors associated with default behaviour and to compare the performance of different classification models in predicting whether a customer will default.

## Methods Used
The following classification models are implemented and compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Regularised Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Random Forests
Model performance is evaluated using confusion matrices and ROC analysis to account for class imbalance.

## Data
The analysis uses the *Default of Credit Card Clients* dataset (30,000 observations, Taiwan).


## Notes
All analysis was conducted in R.  
A fixed random seed was used to ensure reproducibility.
